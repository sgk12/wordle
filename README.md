# Wordle
A command line-based version of Josh Wardle's [Wordle](https://www.powerlanguage.co.uk/wordle/) (minus the one-a-day limit). It's kinda like Squid Game for amateur programmers.

## Instructions
Clone this repo or download its files, and run `python3 wordle.py` in the command line. Note that the [Colorama](https://pypi.org/project/colorama/) Python module is required to support colored text.
